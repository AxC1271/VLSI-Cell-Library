# 🔲Memory Circuits — CMOS VLSI (Full Custom)

Building on the previous Logic Gates project, this repository contains full-custom layouts and simulations of fundamental memory circuits: D Flip-Flop and SR Latch.

Each circuit has its own folder with:
- Custom layout in Magic VLSI
- Schematic in Xcircuit
- LVS checks with Netgen
- SPICE simulation using ngspice
- Parasitic-aware analysis

## 🧠 Theory: Static CMOS Logic

Memory circuits like flip-flops and latches are essential for storing state information in digital systems. They are built using combinations of logic gates and feedback loops.

Key characteristics include:
- Ability to store binary information
- Controlled by clock signals (for flip-flops)
- Static power dissipation similar to logic gates
- Robust against noise and variations

## 🧪 Simulation: Spice Models

Simulation uses BSIM3 Level-49 models from the SCMOS `ami05` 0.5µm process.

```spice
.model nfet NMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=0.71 U0=533 ...)
.model pfet PMOS (LEVEL=49 VTH0=-0.92 U0=202 ...)
```
