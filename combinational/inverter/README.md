# CMOS Inverter

As the "Hello World" of CMOS VLSI design, this project implements an **inverter** using open-source tools. It demonstrates a full-custom flow, from schematic capture and simulation to layout and layout-vs-schematic (LVS) verification.

The goal is to explore basic CMOS behavior and get familiar with digital custom design flows using open tools ‚Äî similar to those used in industry and academia.

### üß† CMOS Inverter Theory

A CMOS inverter consists of a **PMOS pull-up** and **NMOS pull-down** transistor connected in series between VDD and GND. The gates are tied together as the input, and the drains are tied together as the output.

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Input</th>
      <th>PMOS</th>
      <th>NMOS</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>ON</td>
      <td>OFF</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>OFF</td>
      <td>ON</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


This complementary behavior ensures low static power and fast switching.

### Schematic (Xschem)
<div align="center">
  <img src="./inverter_schematic.png" alt="Inverter Schematic" width="600"/>
</div>

Here's a basic schematic of the inverter using Xschem. The TT_Models is there to determine
what kind of simulation will be used to test the inverter. There are other models that perform
corner analysis but since this is a simple inverter, I decided to use a standard simulation.

### üß± Layout (Magic VLSI)
First we draw out our N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs while making sure we don't get any DRC checks, such as n-diffusion layers
meeting a minimum width requirement, the N-well needing to have a minimum size around the P-channel MOSFET, etc.

</div>

After making our PMOS and NMOS, we are ready to make our inverter! Based on our inverter schematic, 
if we connect the gates and sources of each respective gate then we can form the inverter.

- Drawn using n-diffusion, p-diffusion, poly, and metal layers.
- Extracted netlist used for LVS comparison.
- DRC clean.

### üìê SPICE Netlist

- Includes a PMOS and NMOS transistor.
- Simulated using ngspice to observe inverter behavior.

```spice

* 0.01um = 10nm for proper scaling
.option scale=0.01u

* import sky130 models
.lib /usr/local/share/pdk/sky130A/libs.tech/ngspice/sky130.lib.spice tt

* power supply
Vdd Vdd 0 3.3

* input pulse
Vin Vin 0 pulse(0 3.3 100p 50p 50p 500p 1200p)

* transistors from ext2spice
* connect gnd to node 0 (ground)
X0 Vout Vin 0 0 sky130_fd_pr__nfet_01v8 ad=4.75n pd=0.29m as=4.75n ps=0.29m w=95 l=15
X1 Vout Vin Vdd Vdd sky130_fd_pr__pfet_01v8 ad=4.75n pd=0.29m as=4.75n ps=0.29m w=95 l=15

* transient analysis
.control
tran 1p 1200p
plot v(Vin) v(Vout)
.endc

.end
```

behavior of their technology node.

### üìà Simulation (ngspice)

<div align="center">
  <img src="./inverter_waveform.png" alt="CMOS Inverter Waveform" width="600"/>
</div>

This simulation is done directly on the extracted netlist from Magic VLSI:
- Low input ‚Üí high output
- High input ‚Üí low output

The blue waveform is the output while the red waveform is the input pulse, which is acting as expected.
The inverter behaves as expected ‚Äî producing a clean logic inversion with minimal delay or distortion, even with modestly sized transistors.
