# üèõÔ∏è The Cell Museum

**Welcome to the museum!** Each "exhibit" is a fully characterized digital cell: from basic logic gates to sequential elements, designed using open-source EDA tools. This project documents my journey learning IC design from the ground up.

This is a personal collection of custom VLSI standard cells that I made using Xschem (schematic), Magic (layout), ngspice (simulation), and with netgen (complete verification). As a computer
engineering student at Case, I grew interested in CMOS IC design but felt disheartened because industry tools like Cadence Virtuoso are extremely expensive and not easily accessible to most students. Luckily, the tools I used for this project are all open source and can be easily installed using `apt-get` commands on Ubuntu Linux. Check the `download_instructions.txt` file in the repo to see how to download these open source tools!
